This transcript discusses the implementation of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for a model class, specifically for cats. It focuses on the "Update" operation, which was missing in the previous implementation. The goal is to update a cat's information, including its name and age.

The concept of using a static method called `update` is introduced, which takes the cat's ID, new name, and new age as parameters. Inside the `update` method, a SQL query is constructed using the `UPDATE` statement to update the cat's record in the database. The query includes placeholders for the new name, new age, and ID. The method then returns the updated cat's information.

To demonstrate the concept, two routes are created. The first is a `PUT` route that updates the entire cat's information. The cat's ID is obtained from the request parameters, and the new name and age are extracted from the request body. The `Cat.update` method is called with the ID, new name, and new age, and the updated cat's information is returned in the response.

The second route is a `PATCH` route that increments the cat's age by one. Again, the cat's ID is obtained from the request parameters. Since only the age is being updated, the `Cat.update` method cannot be directly used. Instead, a new method called `makeOlder` is created in the `Cat` class. This method constructs a SQL query using the `UPDATE` statement to increment the cat's age by one. The method returns the updated cat's information.

Overall, this transcript demonstrates the implementation of the "Update" operation for cats using static methods and SQL queries. It showcases the flexibility to update the entire cat's information or specific attributes based on the requirements.
