This transcript focuses on adding functionality to a cat model class for creating and deleting cats. Here's a breakdown of the important terms and ideas:

1. RESTful conventions: Refers to following the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) when designing APIs. In this case, a POST request to `/cats` is used to create a new cat.

2. Handler: A function that handles incoming HTTP requests. It typically takes three parameters: `request`, `response`, and `next`.

3. Cat.create: Refers to a static method of the `Cat` class responsible for creating a new cat. It accepts the cat's name and age as parameters.

4. db.query: Represents a database query that is performed asynchronously. It is likely part of a database library used in the project.

5. INSERT statement: An SQL statement used to insert data into a database table. In this case, the `Cat.create` method constructs an `INSERT` query to insert the cat's name and age into the "cats" table.

6. Returning clause: An SQL clause used to specify the data to be returned after an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation. In this case, the returning clause is used to retrieve the ID, name, and age of the newly created cat.

7. Validation logic: The process of checking whether the input data meets certain requirements. In this transcript, validation is added to check if the name and age are present in the request body. If either of them is missing, an error is thrown.

8. Error handling: The use of try-catch blocks to catch and handle errors that may occur during the execution of code. In this case, try-catch is used to handle errors during the creation and deletion of cats.

9. DELETE statement: An SQL statement used to delete records from a database table. The `Cat.delete` method constructs a `DELETE` query to remove a cat from the "cats" table based on its ID.

10. HTTP response: The response sent back to the client after processing an HTTP request. In this transcript, the response is sent in JSON format with a message indicating whether the deletion was successful.

Demonstration:
To demonstrate the concepts, you can perform the following steps:

1. Send a POST request to `/cats` with the following JSON body:
```
{
  "name": "Jello Mittens",
  "age": 4
}
```
This will create a new cat with the name "Jello Mittens" and age 4. The response will include the cat's ID, name, and age.

2. Send a GET request to `/cats` to retrieve all cats. Verify that the newly created cat is included in the response.

3. Send a DELETE request to `/cats/:id` where `:id` is the ID of the cat you want to delete. For example, to delete the cat with ID 4, send a DELETE request to `/cats/4`. The response will indicate that the cat was deleted.

4. Send a GET request to `/cats` again to verify that the deleted cat is no longer present.

Note: Make sure to adjust the request URLs and data according to your setup.
