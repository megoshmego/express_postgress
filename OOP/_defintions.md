1. Simple class approach: Involves creating a class with static methods. Easier to write, shorter, but can be tricky for complex logic and working with associated tables.

2. Smarter class approach: Involves creating an instantiated class with instance methods. Requires setup and instantiation but provides a nicer experience. Easier for validation and complex logic, reduces passing around IDs.

3. Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): Technique to map objects to relational databases. Building a homemade approach is emphasized for better understanding and control.

4. Sequelize: An ORM library for Node.js. Provides a full-featured ORM but has a learning curve and may have documentation limitations.

5. SQL queries: Structured Query Language statements used to interact with databases. Can be written directly or through ORMs.

6. Object-oriented programming (OOP): A programming paradigm that organizes code into objects or classes, enabling code organization, encapsulation, and reusability.

7. Classes: Blueprints or templates for creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior.

8. Encapsulation: Grouping related data and methods together within a class to organize code and hide implementation details.

9. Polymorphism: Objects or classes behaving similarly or sharing methods, allowing for code reuse and flexibility.

10. Model layer: The layer in the application architecture responsible for interacting with the database, separating data/model logic from route logic.

11. RESTful conventions: Designing APIs following the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), using HTTP methods and CRUD operations on resources.

12. Handler: A function that handles incoming HTTP requests, typically taking parameters such as `request`, `response`, and `next`.

13. Validation logic: Checking if input data meets requirements before processing it further.

14. Error handling: Handling and communicating errors that occur during code execution, often using try-catch blocks.

15. DELETE statement: SQL statement to delete records from a database table.

16. HTTP response: The response sent back to the client after processing an HTTP request, often in JSON format.

17. Routes: URL paths and corresponding actions or functions to be executed for specific HTTP requests.

18. Asynchronous operations: Non-blocking operations allowing the program to continue running while awaiting tasks like database queries or API calls to complete.

19. Instance: An object created from a class, having access to instance-specific data and behavior.

20. JSON serialization: Converting objects or data structures into JSON format for communication over the network.

21. Blueprint: A plan or template defining the structure and behavior of objects in a class.

22. Association: Relationship between two objects, often involving linking or connecting related data.

23. Mini ORM: A simplified implementation of an object-relational mapping system, offering limited ORM features.
