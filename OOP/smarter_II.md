Sure! Here's a breakdown of the important terms and ideas from the transcript:

1. RESTful convention: The speaker mentions following the RESTful convention, which refers to designing APIs that adhere to certain principles and guidelines for creating web services. It involves using HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

2. router.post: This refers to defining a route for handling HTTP POST requests in a router or framework. It is used to create new resources or perform actions that modify data on the server.

3. Dog.create: The speaker discusses implementing a method called `create` on the `dog` object (presumably a model or class). This method is responsible for inserting a new row into the database table for dogs. It is expected to take parameters such as `name` and `age` to create a new dog instance.

4. request.body: The speaker mentions that the `name` and `age` values for creating a new dog are stored in `request.body`. This refers to the data included in the body of an HTTP request, which can be accessed in server-side code to extract information sent by the client.

5. Static methods: The speaker refers to defining static methods in the `dog` class. Static methods are associated with the class itself rather than an instance of the class. They can be called without creating an object of the class.

6. Asynchronous operations: The speaker uses `async` and `await` to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Asynchronous operations allow non-blocking execution, enabling the program to continue running while waiting for tasks such as querying a database or making API calls to complete.

7. db.query: The speaker uses `db.query` to execute SQL queries in the code. It likely refers to a database library or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) method for interacting with a database.

8. SQL queries: The speaker demonstrates SQL queries for performing database operations. Examples include `insert into`, `delete from`, and `update` statements to manipulate data in the database.

9. Instance methods: The speaker discusses defining instance methods in the `dog` class. Instance methods are associated with individual instances (objects) of the class and can access instance-specific data and behavior.

10. dog.remove: This is an example of an instance method that the speaker proposes for deleting a dog. It is expected to delete the corresponding row from the database table.

11. dog.save: The speaker suggests implementing a method called `save` in the `dog` class. This method would update the changes made to a dog instance (such as modifying the name or age) in the database.

12. HTTP methods: The speaker mentions various HTTP methods used in the context of creating RESTful routes, including GET, POST, DELETE, and PATCH/PUT. These methods correspond to different actions performed on resources in an API.

13. Routes: The speaker discusses defining routes for handling different HTTP requests. Routes determine the URL paths and the corresponding actions or functions to be executed when requests are made to those paths.

14. Error handling: The speaker briefly mentions error handling by throwing and handling errors using constructs like `throw new express error`. Error handling is an important aspect of building robust applications to gracefully handle and communicate errors that occur during execution.

To provide a simple demonstration, let's consider a simplified code example to demonstrate the concepts:

```javascript
// Dog class
class Dog {
  constructor(id, name, age) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  static async create(name, age) {
    // Simulating database insert
    const newDog = new Dog(1, name, age); // Assuming the ID
