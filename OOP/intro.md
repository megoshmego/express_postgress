This transcript introduces the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) as a way to improve the organization and functionality of code. Here's a breakdown of the important terms and ideas:

1. SQL queries: Refers to the structured query language (SQL) statements used to interact with the database. In the current approach, SQL queries are written directly within the route callbacks, which can lead to long and duplicated code.

2. Object-oriented programming (OOP): A programming paradigm that organizes code into objects or classes, allowing for better code organization, encapsulation, and reusability.

3. Classes: Blueprint or template for creating objects that encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). In this context, classes will be used to model and interact with data from the database.

4. Encapsulation: The concept of grouping related data and methods together within a class, creating a capsule-like structure. It helps organize code and hide implementation details.

5. Polymorphism: The ability of different objects or classes to exhibit similar behavior through shared methods or interfaces. It allows for code reuse and flexibility.

6. Model layer: A layer in the application architecture that handles the interactions with the database. In this transcript, the goal is to build a model layer using OOP principles to separate data or model logic from the route logic.

Demonstration:
To demonstrate the concepts discussed, you can perform the following steps:

1. Identify a portion of your code where SQL queries are written directly in the route callbacks.

2. Create a class that represents the data or model you're working with. For example, if you have a "cats" table, create a "Cat" class.

3. Move the SQL queries related to the "cats" table into methods within the "Cat" class. For instance, you can have methods like `createCat`, `getCat`, `deleteCat`, etc., that encapsulate the corresponding SQL queries.

4. Refactor your route callbacks to use the methods from the "Cat" class instead of directly writing SQL queries.

5. Test your application to ensure that the functionality remains the same after the refactoring.

Note: The actual implementation details will vary based on your specific project and database library/framework. The example provided is a general guideline to illustrate the concept of using classes to encapsulate data and behavior and improve code organization.
