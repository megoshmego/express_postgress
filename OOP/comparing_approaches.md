This transcript compares and contrasts two approaches for writing models: the simple class approach and the smarter class approach. Here's a breakdown of the important terms and ideas:

1. Simple class approach: This approach involves creating a class with only static methods. It is easier to write and can be shorter since it's a collection of methods. It may require passing around IDs to perform actions on existing rows. It is suitable for simple queries but can be trickier for more complex logic or working with associated tables.

2. Smarter class approach: This approach involves creating an instantiated class with real instance methods. It requires setting up the class and creating instances, but once done, it provides a nicer experience. It makes it easier to add validation and handle more complicated logic. It reduces the need to pass around IDs but requires creating new instances of the class.

3. Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): A technique used to map objects to relational databases. The smarter class approach resembles a miniature ORM, where queries are made and data is mapped into objects. While there are ORM libraries available for JavaScript, the transcript emphasizes building a homemade approach for better understanding and control.

4. Sequelize: An ORM library for Node.js mentioned in the transcript. While it provides a full-featured ORM, it has a learning curve, and the documentation may not be ideal. Choosing to use Sequelize or other ORM libraries is an option, but building a homemade approach allows for a better understanding of how ORMs work and provides more control over specific queries.

Demonstration:
To demonstrate the concepts discussed, you can perform the following steps:

1. Identify the model or models you're working with and determine if a simple class approach or a smarter class approach is more suitable based on the complexity of the logic and the need for instance methods.

2. Implement the chosen approach by creating the corresponding class(es) for the model(s). For the simple class approach, define static methods that handle the required queries. For the smarter class approach, create an instantiated class with instance methods that interact with the database.

3. Refactor your code to use the methods of the chosen approach instead of directly writing SQL queries in the route callbacks.

4. Compare the benefits and drawbacks of each approach based on your implementation and the specific requirements of your project.

5. Test your application to ensure that the functionality remains intact after the refactoring.

Note: The actual implementation details will vary based on your specific project and the database library/framework you are using. The example provided is a general guideline to illustrate the concept of choosing between a simple class approach and a smarter class approach when building models in Node.js.
