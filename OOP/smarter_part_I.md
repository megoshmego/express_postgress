In the given transcript, the following important terms and ideas are discussed:

1. Static Methods: The use of static methods in the Dog class is highlighted. These methods can be called directly on the class itself, without needing to instantiate an object. Examples include `Dog.getAll()` and `Dog.getByID()`.

2. JSON Serialization: The transcript demonstrates how Express automatically serializes objects into JSON format when sending responses. The properties of the Dog class instances are automatically included in the JSON response.

3. Error Handling: The importance of error handling is mentioned. The use of `express-error-handler` middleware and throwing custom errors, such as `express-error`, is shown.

4. Model Class: The concept of a model class is introduced. The Dog class serves as a blueprint or template for creating dog objects. It defines properties, a constructor, and potentially additional methods.

5. GET Requests: The use of GET requests to retrieve data from the server is demonstrated. The routes `/dogs` and `/dogs/:id` are set up to handle GET requests for retrieving all dogs and a specific dog by ID, respectively.

6. Sequel Query: The transcript includes the use of SQL queries to retrieve data from the database. The queries involve selecting specific columns from the "dogs" table and using conditions, such as `WHERE ID = :id`, to filter the results.

7. Object Instantiation: The process of creating instances of the Dog class from the retrieved data is shown. The `results.rows` array is iterated over, and a new Dog object is created for each row using the constructor and the data from the row.

8. Custom Error: The use of a custom error, `DogNotFoundError`, is mentioned. This error is thrown when a specific dog is not found based on the provided ID, and it results in a 404 status code being returned in the response.

9. try-catch: The importance of error handling is emphasized by wrapping code blocks that may potentially throw errors in a try-catch statement. This ensures that any errors are caught and can be properly handled, such as by returning an error response.

Here's a simplified demonstration of the concepts discussed:

```javascript
// Model: Dog.js
class Dog {
  constructor(id, name, age) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  static async getAll() {
    const results = await DB.query('SELECT ID, name, age FROM dogs');
    return results.rows.map(row => new Dog(row.ID, row.name, row.age));
  }

  static async getByID(id) {
    const results = await DB.query('SELECT ID, name, age FROM dogs WHERE ID = $1', [id]);
    if (!results.rows[0]) {
      throw new ExpressError('Dog not found', 404);
    }
    const row = results.rows[0];
    return new Dog(row.ID, row.name, row.age);
  }
}

// Route: dogs.js
router.get('/dogs', async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const dogs = await Dog.getAll();
    res.json(dogs);
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
});

router.get('/dogs/:id', async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const dog = await Dog.getByID(req.params.id);
    res.json(dog);
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
});
```

In this demonstration, the `Dog` class is used to retrieve all dogs and a specific dog by ID. The `Dog.getAll()` method retrieves data from the database, creates `Dog` instances for each row, and returns an array of dogs. The `Dog.getByID()`
