Important terms and ideas from the transcript:
1. Model class: Refers to a class that represents a data model or an object in an object-oriented programming paradigm.
2. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): A technique used to map objects from a relational database to object-oriented programming languages.
3. Static methods: Methods that belong to a class rather than an instance of the class. They can be called without creating an object of the class.
4. Instantiation: The process of creating an instance or object of a class.
5. Instance methods: Methods that are defined inside a class and can be called on instances or objects of that class.
6. Blueprint: A plan or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects in a class.
7. Association: A relationship between two objects where one object is related to the other in some way.
8. Mini ORM: Refers to the implementation of an object-relational mapping system that provides a simplified and limited set of ORM features.

Simple demonstration:
Let's consider the example of the "Dog" model class mentioned in the transcript. In this case, the "Dog" class represents a data model for dogs. It will have properties and methods associated with dogs.

```javascript
class Dog {
  constructor(id, name, age) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  static findAll() {
    // Retrieve all dogs from the database
    // and return an array of Dog instances
  }

  static findById(id) {
    // Find a dog by its ID in the database
    // and return a Dog instance
  }

  static create(name, age) {
    // Create a new dog in the database
    // and return a Dog instance representing the newly created dog
  }

  speak() {
    // Make the dog speak
  }

  fetch() {
    // Make the dog fetch an object
  }
}

// Usage
const dogs = Dog.findAll(); // Get all dogs from the database as an array of Dog instances
const dog = Dog.findById(1); // Find a dog by its ID and get a Dog instance
const newDog = Dog.create("Buddy", 3); // Create a new dog and get a Dog instance
dog.speak(); // Make the dog with ID 1 speak
dog.fetch(); // Make the dog with ID 1 fetch an object
```

In this demonstration, we create a "Dog" class with properties like `id`, `name`, and `age`. We have static methods like `findAll`, `findById`, and `create` for retrieving dogs from the database and creating new dogs. The `speak` and `fetch` methods are instance methods that can be called on a specific dog object.

By following this model class approach, we can instantiate new dog objects, call instance methods on them, and perform database operations using static methods. It provides a more object-oriented and structured way of working with data models.
