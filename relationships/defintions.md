1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): A programming paradigm that organizes code by encapsulating data and methods into classes. It promotes code reusability, modularity, and polymorphism.

2. Refactoring: Restructuring existing code to improve its design, readability, and maintainability without changing its external behavior. It involves separating concerns, eliminating redundancies, and enhancing code organization.

3. Encapsulation: The practice of grouping related data and methods together within a class or object. It allows for better code organization, hides implementation details, and improves code maintainability and understandability.

4. Polymorphism: The ability of different types or objects to exhibit similar behavior or have common methods. It allows for code flexibility, abstraction, and the ability to treat objects of different types uniformly.

5. SQL Join Query: A query that combines data from multiple database tables based on common fields or relationships. It allows for retrieving related data and performing operations across different tables.

6. Many-to-Many Relationship: A relationship between entities where multiple instances of one entity can be associated with multiple instances of another entity. It requires a middle table to establish the relationship.

7. Data Retrieval: The process of fetching specific data from a database using SQL queries. It involves selecting desired columns, joining tables, and specifying conditions to retrieve relevant data.

8. Naming Considerations: The practice of choosing meaningful and descriptive names for tables, columns, and other elements in the database schema. It enhances code readability and reduces confusion.

9. Route Setup: The configuration of routes in an Express application to handle specific HTTP requests and define their corresponding actions. It involves specifying the route URL, HTTP method, and callback functions.

10. Data Transformation: The process of converting data from one format to another. In the context of the transcript, it refers to manipulating the retrieved data to meet specific requirements or desired output format.

11. Error Handling: The practice of managing and addressing errors that occur during program execution. It involves catching and handling exceptions, providing meaningful error messages, and ensuring graceful handling of unexpected situations.

12. One-to-Many Relationship: A relationship between entities where one entity can have multiple related entities in another entity. It represents a hierarchical or parent-child relationship.

13. Joined Table: A table that combines data from multiple tables using joins based on common keys or relationships. It allows for querying and retrieving data that spans across different tables.
