In the given transcript, the important terms and ideas are as follows:

1. One-to-Many Relationship: It refers to a relationship between two entities where one entity can have multiple related entities in another entity. In the example, the relationship between users and messages represents a one-to-many relationship.

2. Many-to-Many Relationship: It refers to a relationship between two entities where multiple entities can be associated with multiple entities from another entity. In the example, the relationship between tags and messages represents a many-to-many relationship.

3. Joined Table: A joined table combines information from multiple tables using a common key or relationship. In the example, the joined table combines message IDs and tag codes to associate messages with multiple tags.

4. Route Setup: The transcript demonstrates setting up a route to handle a GET request for retrieving a message and its associated tags based on the provided ID.

5. SQL Query: The transcript mentions the need to write a SQL query to fetch the tags associated with a specific message. The query involves joining the "messages" and "messages_tags" tables to retrieve the corresponding tag names.

To provide a simple demonstration, here's an example of how the SQL query might look based on the information provided:

```javascript
SELECT m.id, m.message, t.tag_name
FROM messages m
JOIN messages_tags mt ON m.id = mt.message_id
JOIN tags t ON mt.tag_code = t.code
WHERE m.id = 1;
```

This query fetches the message with ID 1 along with its associated tag names. The result will include the message ID, message text, and the corresponding tag names.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and the actual implementation may vary based on the specific database schema and query structure.
