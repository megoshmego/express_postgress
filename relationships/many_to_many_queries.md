In the given transcript, the important terms and ideas are as follows:

1. SQL Query: The transcript demonstrates the construction and execution of a SQL query to retrieve data from the database. The query involves joining multiple tables and selecting specific columns.

2. Route Setup: The transcript shows the setup of a route in the application to handle GET requests for retrieving messages along with their corresponding tags based on the provided ID.

3. Data Transformation: The transcript showcases how to transform the retrieved data into a desired format. It involves isolating the ID and message values from the query result and mapping the tag values into an array.

4. Error Handling: The transcript emphasizes the importance of error handling and suggests implementing appropriate error handling mechanisms, such as catching and handling errors in async functions.

To provide a simple demonstration, here's an example illustrating the concepts discussed:

```javascript
// SQL Query
const query = `
SELECT m.message_id, m.message, t.tag_name
FROM messages m
JOIN messages_tags mt ON m.message_id = mt.message_id
JOIN tags t ON mt.tag_code = t.tag_code
WHERE m.message_id = $1;
`;

// Retrieving Data and Transformation
const result = await db.query(query, [1]); // Assuming ID 1
const { message_id, message } = result.rows[0];
const tags = result.rows.map((row) => row.tag_name);

// Responding with the Transformed Data
res.send({ message_id, message, tags });
```

In this example, the SQL query retrieves the message with ID 1 along with its associated tags. The retrieved data is then transformed by extracting the message ID and message text and mapping the tag names into an array. Finally, the transformed data (ID, message, and tags) is sent as a response.

Please note that this is a simplified demonstration, and the actual implementation may vary based on the specific database schema, query structure, and framework used.
