Terms and definitions:

1. Asynchronous Functions: Functions in JavaScript marked with the `async` keyword that allow non-blocking code execution and return Promises.

2. Async/Await: A JavaScript syntax using the `async` and `await` keywords to simplify handling of asynchronous operations.

3. Error Handling: The process of managing and addressing errors that may occur during code execution, often using try-catch blocks.

4. Unhandled Promise Rejection: When a Promise is rejected but no error handler is attached, resulting in warnings or errors being logged.

5. pg SQL driver: The PostgreSQL SQL driver for Node.js used to interact with PostgreSQL databases.

6. Express app: A web application built using the Express framework for Node.js.

7. Middleware: Functions executed in the request-response cycle of an Express app, modifying request/response objects or performing additional operations.

8. Routes: Definitions of URL paths and corresponding actions or functions for handling requests in an Express app.

9. Database: A structured collection of data organized for storage and management.

10. SQL file: A file containing SQL statements for execution against a database.

11. URI: Uniform Resource Identifier, a string identifying a resource (e.g., database connection string).

12. Connection: The establishment of a connection between a Node.js application and a PostgreSQL database using the pg package.

13. Client: An object provided by the pg package representing a connection to the PostgreSQL database and allowing SQL query execution.

14. Query: A request for data or an action to be performed on a database, often in the form of SQL statements.

15. Promises: Objects representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, used to handle results.

16. JSON response: A response sent to the client in JSON format, commonly containing retrieved data or operation success/failure information.

17. SQL injection: A security vulnerability resulting from untrusted data inserted into SQL statements without proper sanitization, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation.

18. Test database: A separate database used specifically for testing purposes to avoid impacting the production database.

19. Test fixtures: Predefined data or state used in tests to ensure consistent and predictable test results.

20. Mocking: A technique substituting real objects or components with simulated versions for testing, isolating code from external dependencies.

21. Test-driven development (TDD): An approach where tests are written before code implementation to ensure code meets specified requirements.

22. Test coverage: A metric measuring the extent to which code is covered by tests, indicating the percentage of tested code.

23. API testing: Testing the functionality, reliability, and performance of an API.

24. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): A programming paradigm organizing code into objects and classes, promoting reusability and code organization.

25. Refactoring: Restructuring existing code to improve design, readability, and maintainability without changing external behavior.

26. Encapsulation: Grouping related data and methods within a class or object to improve code organization and maintainability.

27. Polymorphism: The ability of different types or objects to exhibit similar behavior or have common methods, promoting code flexibility and abstraction.

28. SQL Join Query: A query combining data from multiple database tables based on common fields or relationships.

29. Many-to-Many Relationship: A relationship where multiple instances of one entity can be associated with multiple instances of another entity.

30. Data Retrieval: The process of fetching specific data from a database using SQL queries.

31. Naming Considerations: The practice of choosing meaningful and descriptive names for tables, columns, and other elements in the database schema.

32. Route Setup: Configuring routes in an Express app to handle specific HTTP requests and define their actions.

33. Data Transformation: Converting data from one format to another
