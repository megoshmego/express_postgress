Important terms and ideas from the transcript:
1. CRUD: An acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the basic operations performed on data in a database.
2. Routes: Defines the different URL paths and corresponding actions or functions to be executed when requests are made to those paths.
3. POST request: A type of HTTP request used to submit data to be processed by the server.
4. Destructuring: A feature in JavaScript that allows you to extract values from objects or arrays into distinct variables.
5. JSON: JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data interchange format that is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application.
6. Insert statement: A SQL statement used to insert new records into a database table.
7. Parameterize: The process of using placeholders in SQL queries to prevent SQL injection and improve security.
8. Returning clause: A SQL clause used to specify which data should be returned after executing an insert, update, or delete statement.
9. Status code: A three-digit number included in HTTP responses that indicates the status of the request.
10. 201 - Created: A status code that indicates a successful creation of a resource.
11. Async function: A function that allows you to write asynchronous code using the async/await syntax, making it easier to handle asynchronous operations.
12. Try-catch: A JavaScript construct used to handle exceptions or errors that may occur within a specific block of code.
13. Debugging: The process of identifying and fixing errors or issues in a program by examining its behavior and data flow.
14. Array indexing: Accessing elements in an array using their index, where the first element has an index of 0.
15. JSON response: The response sent back to the client in JSON format, typically containing data retrieved or created in the database.

Simple demonstration of concepts:
- The transcript focuses on implementing the create operation (C) in CRUD for users.
- A new route is defined for creating a user using a POST request to `/users`.
- The request body is expected to contain a `name` and `type` for the new user.
- The query to insert the new user into the database is parameterized to prevent SQL injection.
- The returning clause is used to specify which data should be returned after the insert operation.
- The created user data is sent back as a JSON response using `res.json`.
- Error handling is implemented using a try-catch block, and any caught errors are passed to the next middleware using `next`.
- The concept of status codes is introduced, and the status code 201 (Created) is used to indicate a successful creation.
- Debugging techniques are briefly mentioned, such as using `console.log` or adding a debugger to inspect variables and data during development.
- The importance of returning the desired data and formatting the response is discussed, and a minor tweak is made to return only the first row/object of the result in the JSON response.
- A demonstration is provided by sending POST requests with different user data and observing the successful creation of new users and the returned data in the response.
