Terms and definitions:

1. Asynchronous Functions: Functions in JavaScript that allow for non-blocking code execution. They are marked with the `async` keyword and return a Promise.

2. Async/Await: A syntax in JavaScript that allows for easier handling of asynchronous operations. The `async` keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, and the `await` keyword is used to wait for a Promise to resolve or reject.

3. Error Handling: The process of handling and managing errors that may occur during the execution of code. It involves using mechanisms like try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions.

4. Unhandled Promise Rejection: Occurs when a Promise is rejected but no error handler is attached to handle the rejection. It can result in warnings or errors being logged.

5. pg SQL driver: The PostgreSQL SQL driver for Node.js, used for connecting to and interacting with PostgreSQL databases.

6. Express app: An application built using the Express framework, which provides tools and functionalities for building web applications in Node.js.

7. Middleware: Functions that are executed in the request-response cycle of an Express app. They can modify the request or response objects, or perform additional operations before the final response is sent.

8. Routes: Define the URL paths and corresponding actions or functions to be executed when requests are made to those paths in an Express app.

9. Database: A structured collection of data that is organized and stored for easy access and management. In this context, it refers to the PostgreSQL database being used in the example.

10. SQL file: A file containing SQL statements that can be executed against a database.

11. URI: Uniform Resource Identifier, a string of characters that identifies a resource. In this context, it refers to the string used to connect to the PostgreSQL database.

12. Connection: The establishment of a connection between the Node.js application and the PostgreSQL database using the pg package.

13. Client: An object provided by the pg package that represents a connection to the PostgreSQL database and allows executing SQL queries.

14. Query: A request for data or an action to be performed on a database. In this context, it refers to SQL statements executed against the PostgreSQL database.

15. Asynchronous nature: Refers to the non-blocking nature of JavaScript and the need to handle asynchronous operations such as database queries using mechanisms like Promises or async/await.

16. Promises: Objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. They are used to handle the result of an asynchronous operation when it becomes available.

17. JSON response: The response sent back to the client in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. It typically contains data retrieved from the database or information about the success/failure of an operation.

18. SQL injection: A security vulnerability that occurs when untrusted data is inserted into SQL statements without proper sanitization. It can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the database.

19. Test database: A separate database used specifically for testing purposes to avoid affecting the production database during testing and development.

20. Test fixtures: Predefined data or state used in tests to ensure consistent and predictable test results.

21. Mocking: The technique of substituting real objects or components with simulated or "mocked" versions for testing purposes. It allows isolating the code being tested from external dependencies.

22. Test-driven development (TDD): A software development approach where tests are written before the code implementation to ensure that the code meets the specified requirements.

23. Test coverage: A metric that measures the extent to which the codebase is covered by tests. It indicates the percentage of code that has been tested and helps identify areas that require additional testing.

24. API testing: The practice of testing the functionality, reliability, and performance of an API (Application Programming
