In the given transcript, there are a few important terms and ideas related to error handling and asynchronous functions. Here's an overview with some simple examples:

1. Asynchronous Functions: Asynchronous functions in JavaScript allow for non-blocking code execution. They are denoted by the `async` keyword and return a Promise.

Example:
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  // asynchronous operations
}
```

2. Async/Await: The `async` keyword allows you to use the `await` keyword inside the function. `await` waits for a Promise to be resolved or rejected before proceeding with further execution.

Example:
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const data = await fetch(url);
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

3. Error Handling: Error handling is crucial in asynchronous functions to prevent crashes and handle any exceptions that may occur. The `try` and `catch` blocks are used to handle errors within an asynchronous function.

Example:
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const data = await fetch(url);
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

4. Unhandled Promise Rejection: If an error occurs within an asynchronous function and it is not handled, it results in an "Unhandled promise rejection" warning. To handle such rejections, it's important to use `try/catch` or attach a `.catch()` block to the Promise.

Example:
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  const data = await fetch(url).catch(error => console.error(error));
  console.log(data);
}
```

These concepts and error handling patterns are crucial in ensuring that errors are properly caught and handled in asynchronous code, preventing server crashes and allowing for graceful error responses.
