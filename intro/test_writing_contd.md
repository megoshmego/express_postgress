Important terms and ideas in the transcript:

1. Testing an Express app: The transcript discusses the process of testing an Express app with a Postgres database. It covers the use of test frameworks like Jest and the supertest library to write tests for different routes.

2. Test cases for CRUD operations: The transcript focuses on testing the POST, PATCH, and DELETE routes for creating, updating, and deleting users. It demonstrates how to write test cases with different expectations for status codes, response bodies, and error handling.

3. Test setup and teardown: The transcript mentions the use of `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks to set up and clean up the database before and after each test. It also suggests severing the connection to the database after all tests are completed.

Demonstration:

A simple demonstration of writing a test case for the POST route to create a new user using Jest and supertest can be as follows:

```javascript
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('./app');

describe('POST /users', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Set up the database or create necessary test data
    // before each test
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Clean up the database or reset test data
    // after each test
  });

  it('creates a new user', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/users')
      .send({ name: 'BillyBob', type: 'staff' });

    expect(response.statusCode).toBe(201);
    expect(response.body.user).toEqual({
      id: expect.any(Number),
      name: 'BillyBob',
      type: 'staff',
    });
  });
});
```

In the above example, the test case verifies that a new user is created by sending a POST request to the `/users` route with the name and type data. The response status code is checked to be 201 (created), and the response body is expected to contain a user object with an auto-generated `id`, the provided `name`, and `type`. The `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks can be used to set up and clean up the database as needed for each test.
