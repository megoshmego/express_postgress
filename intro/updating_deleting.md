Important terms and ideas from the transcript:
1. Patch request: An HTTP request method used to update or modify an existing resource.
2. Request body: The data sent with an HTTP request that contains the information necessary to update a resource.
3. Validation: The process of ensuring that the data being submitted is correct and meets certain criteria or constraints.
4. Query: A statement used to retrieve or manipulate data in a database.
5. Update query: A type of query used to modify existing data in a database.
6. Request params: The parameters extracted from the URL of an HTTP request.
7. Destructuring: A JavaScript feature that allows extracting values from objects or arrays into individual variables.
8. Error handling: The practice of catching and responding to errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of code.
9. res.send(): A method used in Express to send a response to an HTTP request.
10. Catch block: A section of code that is executed when an error occurs within a try block.
11. DELETE request: An HTTP request method used to delete a specified resource.
12. Lightweight ORM: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that allows mapping between objects and database records. A lightweight ORM simplifies database operations by providing a simplified interface without the full features of a comprehensive ORM.
13. Testing: The process of evaluating a system or component to determine whether it satisfies the specified requirements and functions as expected.
14. API testing: The practice of testing the functionality, reliability, and performance of an API (Application Programming Interface).
15. Test logic: The code written to define and execute tests to verify the behavior and functionality of the system being tested.
16. Test fixtures: Predefined data or state used in tests to ensure consistent and predictable test results.
17. Mocking: The technique of substituting a real object or component with a simulated or "mocked" object for testing purposes.
18. Test-driven development (TDD): A software development approach where tests are written before the code implementation to ensure that the code meets the specified requirements.
19. Test coverage: A measure of how much of the codebase is covered by tests, indicating the extent to which the code has been tested.

Simple demonstration of concepts:
- The transcript introduces the concepts of updating and deleting users in an Express app with a database.
- The PATCH request method is used to update user data, and the DELETE request method is used to delete users.
- The code uses the `request.body` object to extract the new name and type of the user to be updated.
- A SQL update query is written to modify the user's information in the database.
- The `request.params` object is used to retrieve the ID of the user to be updated or deleted.
- The code demonstrates error handling using try-catch blocks and returns appropriate error messages using `next(error)`.
- The response is sent using `res.send()` to indicate a successful update or deletion.
- The code shows the use of database queries with `DB.query()` to perform CRUD operations.
- The transcript mentions the absence of explicit commits in this setup, as the changes are directly executed in the database.
- It highlights the potential need for testing to ensure the correctness and functionality of the implemented logic.
- The transcript foreshadows the upcoming topic of testing an Express app with a database.
- It suggests the importance of testing the newly implemented logic to verify that the desired operations (insertion, deletion, etc.) are functioning as expected.
- The transcript emphasizes the need to test the interactions between the Express app and the database to ensure proper functionality.

Overall, the transcript provides a basic understanding of updating and deleting users in an Express app with a database, along with insights into error handling and the use of database queries. It
