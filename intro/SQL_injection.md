Important terms and ideas from the transcript:
1. Async/Await: JavaScript syntax that simplifies asynchronous code execution by allowing the use of the "await" keyword to wait for the resolution of a promise.
2. Promises: JavaScript objects used for handling asynchronous operations. They represent a value that may be available in the future or an error that occurs during an asynchronous operation.
3. Error handling: The process of capturing and managing errors that occur during program execution to prevent crashes and handle exceptional situations gracefully.
4. Unhandled promise rejection: An error that occurs when a promise is rejected but no error handling is implemented for it.
5. Try-catch: A JavaScript construct used to catch and handle exceptions or errors that occur within a specific block of code.
6. Status code: A three-digit number included in HTTP responses that indicates the status of the request or the occurrence of an error.
7. 500 - Internal Server Error: A status code indicating that an unexpected error occurred on the server.
8. Custom error handling: The ability to create and handle custom errors in a way that provides meaningful error messages and appropriate status codes.
9. Express error handling: The process of handling errors in an Express application by defining error-handling middleware functions.

Simple demonstration of concepts:
- The transcript discusses the importance of handling errors in async functions and demonstrates the consequences of not handling them.
- Initially, an error occurs in the async function when a non-existent table is referenced in the query.
- Without proper error handling, the server crashes, and an unhandled promise rejection warning is shown.
- To handle errors in an async function, a try-catch block is used. The code within the try block is wrapped, and any caught error is passed to the next middleware function using `next(error)`.
- By implementing error handling, the server no longer crashes, and an error response with a status code of 500 (Internal Server Error) is sent.
- Custom error handling is mentioned as a way to create and handle custom errors with specific messages and status codes.
- The concept of Express error handling is introduced, and the use of error-handling middleware functions is mentioned as a way to handle and respond to errors in a centralized manner.
- A demonstration is provided by intentionally causing an error in the async function and observing the server's response with and without proper error handling.
