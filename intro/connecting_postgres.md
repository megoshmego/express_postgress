Important terms and ideas from the transcript:
1. pg SQL driver: Refers to the PostgreSQL SQL driver for Node.js, used to connect and interact with PostgreSQL databases.
2. Express app: An application built using the Express framework, which provides a set of tools and functionalities for building web applications in Node.js.
3. Middleware: Refers to the `express.json` middleware, used to parse the body of requests as JSON.
4. Routes: Defines the different URL paths and corresponding actions or functions to be executed when requests are made to those paths.
5. Database: Refers to the PostgreSQL database being used in the example.
6. SQL file: A file containing SQL statements that can be executed against a database.
7. URI: Uniform Resource Identifier, a string of characters that identifies a resource, in this case, the PostgreSQL database.
8. Connection: Establishing a connection between the Node.js application and the PostgreSQL database using the pg package.
9. Client: A class provided by the pg package that represents a connection to the PostgreSQL database.
10. Query: A SQL statement executed against a database to retrieve or manipulate data.
11. Asynchronous nature: JavaScript's non-blocking nature and the need to handle asynchronous operations, such as database queries, using promises, callbacks, or async/await.
12. Promises: Objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and allow you to handle the result when it's ready.
13. Async/await: A syntax in JavaScript that allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous-like manner, making it easier to work with promises and handle asynchronous operations.
14. JSON response: The response sent back to the client in JSON format, typically containing data retrieved from the database.
15. SQL injection: A security vulnerability that occurs when untrusted data is inserted into SQL statements without proper sanitization, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate or gain unauthorized access to the database.
16. Test database: A separate database used for testing purposes to avoid affecting the production database during testing and development.

Simple demonstration of concepts:
- The transcript walks through setting up an Express app skeleton and introduces the pg SQL driver.
- A PostgreSQL database is created using a SQL file, and a connection to the database is established using the pg package.
- A route is defined to retrieve all users from the database using a SQL query.
- Asynchronous handling is demonstrated by using async/await with the `db.query` method to ensure the query completes before sending the response.
- The response, containing the retrieved data, is sent back in JSON format.
- The use of promises, async/await, and the pg package's `Client` class is explained.
- The importance of SQL injection prevention and the concept of using a separate test database for testing purposes is mentioned.
